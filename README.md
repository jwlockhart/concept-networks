# concept-networks

This repo contains code for runing network-based analyses of codes applied to qualitative data. In short, the goal is to map the relationships between concepts in qualitative data in a graph/network structure. For one example of such analyses, see:

Ghaziani, Amin and Delia Baldassarri. 2011. "Cultural Anchors and the Organization of Differences: A Multi-Method Analysis of LGBT Marches on Washington." *American Sociological Review* 76(2):179â€“206.

All code for this project will use open-source libraries rather than proprietary network analysis and statistical software. Initial qualitative coding of the data was done by a team of research assistants working on separate clones of a [Dedoose](http://www.dedoose.com) project. The excerpts and their codes are exported and compared to calculate metrics of inter-rater reliability. The codes are then used to generate networks for analysis. 

A small NLP alternative is also implemented. In this approach, document similarity is used to relate codes, rather than the cooccurance frequencies of code pairs. This code is not meant to replicate the results from the first approach, but rather to complement them with additional information.
